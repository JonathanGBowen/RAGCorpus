# Installation Guide - Understanding Your Options

## What does `pip install -e .` do?

**Short answer:** Installs the package in "editable mode" from `pyproject.toml`

**Longer answer:**
- The `-e` flag means "editable" or "development mode"
- The `.` means "current directory"
- It reads `pyproject.toml` and installs all dependencies listed there
- **Advantage:** If you modify source code, changes are immediately available
- **Advantage:** One command installs everything
- **Disadvantage:** Installs ALL dependencies (~5GB)

## Alternative: requirements.txt

I've created **three options** for you:

### Option 1: Full Install (Original)
```bash
pip install -e .
```
**OR**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Both do the same thing!**
- Installs all ~50 packages
- Size: ~5GB (mostly PyTorch for translation)
- Includes: OCR, translation, all integrations
- Best for: Your original use case (German texts, scanned PDFs)

### Option 2: Minimal Install (Lightweight)
```bash
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```
- Installs only core RAG functionality
- Size: ~500MB-1GB
- Includes: Basic PDF search, chat interface
- **Missing:** OCR, translation, Obsidian, Zotero, paper finder
- Best for: Testing, English-only docs, clean PDFs

### Option 3: Custom Install (Pick Features)
```bash
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
pip install -r requirements-optional.txt
```
- Start minimal, add features you need
- Choose specific packages from requirements-optional.txt
- Best for: Customizing to your needs

## Which Should You Use?

### Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` if:
âœ… You have German documents (needs translation = 2.5GB)
âœ… You have scanned/poor quality PDFs (needs OCR)
âœ… You use Obsidian Canvas files
âœ… You want Zotero integration
âœ… You want paper auto-download
âœ… You want ALL features working

**This is YOU based on your requirements!**

### Use `pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt` if:
âœ… You want to test the system first
âœ… All your documents are English
âœ… All your PDFs are clean (text-selectable)
âœ… You don't need integrations yet
âœ… You want to save disk space (~4GB savings)

**Start here to try it out, add features later**

## Installation Comparison

| Method | Command | Size | Features | Use When |
|--------|---------|------|----------|----------|
| **Editable** | `pip install -e .` | ~5GB | All | Development |
| **Full** | `pip install -r requirements.txt` | ~5GB | All | Production |
| **Minimal** | `pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt` | ~1GB | Core only | Testing |
| **Custom** | Install specific packages | Varies | Your choice | Selective |

## Step-by-Step Installation

### Recommended for Your Use Case

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Install Tesseract OCR (external)
# Windows: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
# macOS: brew install tesseract tesseract-lang
# Linux: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-deu

# 3. Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add GOOGLE_API_KEY

# 4. Test
python scripts/test_system.py

# 5. Use
python scripts/ingest_corpus.py
chainlit run src/ui/app.py
```

### Start Minimal, Add Later

```bash
# 1. Install core only
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt

# 2. Test basic functionality
python scripts/test_system.py

# 3. Add features as needed:

# If you need OCR:
pip install opencv-python pytesseract pypdfium2 Pillow

# If you need translation:
pip install torch transformers sentencepiece

# If you need Zotero:
pip install pyzotero

# If you need paper download:
pip install paperscraper

# If you need web search:
pip install tavily-python langchain-community
```

## Understanding the Dependencies

### The Big Ones (Why It's 5GB)

**PyTorch: ~2GB**
- Needed for: German translation models
- Skip if: All documents are English
- Savings: ~2.5GB

**Transformers: ~500MB**
- Needed for: ML models, translation
- Skip if: No translation needed
- Savings: ~500MB

**OpenCV: ~100MB**
- Needed for: Image preprocessing for OCR
- Skip if: No scanned PDFs
- Savings: ~200MB (with related packages)

**Everything else: ~2GB**
- LlamaIndex, LangChain, ChromaDB, Chainlit, etc.
- **Required** - This is the core functionality

### What Can You Skip?

**You can safely skip:**
- `torch`, `transformers` (2.5GB) - if no German translation
- `opencv-python`, `pytesseract` (200MB) - if no scanned PDFs
- `pyjsoncanvas` (2MB) - if no Obsidian Canvas
- `pyzotero` (5MB) - if no Zotero integration
- `paperscraper` (10MB) - if no auto paper download
- `tavily-python` (5MB) - if no web search

**Total potential savings: ~3GB**

**But for your use case (German + scanned PDFs), you need most of it!**

## Why Not Just `pip install -e .`?

`pip install -e .` is great for:
âœ… Development (code changes apply immediately)
âœ… Contributing to the project
âœ… One-command install

But `requirements.txt` is better for:
âœ… Flexibility (choose what to install)
âœ… Understanding what you're installing
âœ… Saving disk space (minimal install)
âœ… Standard Python practice
âœ… Easier troubleshooting

**Both work! Use whichever you prefer.**

## Disk Space Summary

```
Full Install (requirements.txt):
â”œâ”€â”€ PyTorch + Translation      2.5 GB  (skip if English-only)
â”œâ”€â”€ OCR Libraries              0.2 GB  (skip if clean PDFs)
â”œâ”€â”€ Core RAG Stack             2.0 GB  (required)
â”œâ”€â”€ Integrations               0.3 GB  (optional)
â””â”€â”€ Total                      5.0 GB

Minimal Install (requirements-minimal.txt):
â”œâ”€â”€ Core RAG Stack             2.0 GB  (required)
â””â”€â”€ Total                      2.0 GB
```

## My Recommendation

Based on your requirements (ADHD academic, Gestalt/Dewey, German texts, scanned PDFs):

### Use Full Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Why:**
1. You specifically mentioned German texts â†’ need translation (2.5GB)
2. You mentioned "poor OCR readings" â†’ need OCR pipeline (200MB)
3. Academic research â†’ want all integrations
4. 5GB is reasonable for a comprehensive research tool

**The dependencies ARE necessary for your use case!**

### Alternative: Start Minimal
```bash
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```
Test the system, then add features:
```bash
pip install torch transformers  # Add translation
pip install opencv-python pytesseract  # Add OCR
```

---

## Verifying Your Install

After installation, test what you have:

```bash
# Test system
python scripts/test_system.py

# Check specific features
python -c "import cv2; print('âœ“ OCR support available')"
python -c "import torch; print('âœ“ Translation support available')"
python -c "import pyzotero; print('âœ“ Zotero integration available')"
```

---

## Updating Dependencies

```bash
# Update all packages
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

# Update specific package
pip install llama-index --upgrade
```

---

## Common Issues

### "Package not found"
**Solution:** Check package name, update pip
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### "Disk space full"
**Solution:** Use minimal install
```bash
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

### "Import error after install"
**Solution:** Reinstall problematic package
```bash
pip uninstall <package>
pip install <package>
```

---

## Summary

**Question:** Should I use `pip install -e .` or `requirements.txt`?

**Answer:** Either works!

- `pip install -e .` â†’ Quick, installs everything, good for development
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` â†’ Same result, more standard
- `pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt` â†’ Lightweight, add features later

**For your use case:** Use `requirements.txt` (full install) because you need German translation and OCR support, which account for most of the size.

**Want to experiment?** Start with `requirements-minimal.txt` and add features as needed.

Both paths lead to a working system! ðŸš€
