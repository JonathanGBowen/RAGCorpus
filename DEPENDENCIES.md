## üíæ Storage Impact

### Disk Space Breakdown
```
Core packages:           ~500MB
OCR support:            ~200MB
Translation (PyTorch):  ~2.5GB  ‚¨Ö BIGGEST!
Integrations:           ~50MB
Your documents:         varies
Vector embeddings:      ~500MB per 1000 docs
Models (downloaded):    ~1GB per embedding model
-----------------------------------
Total (full install):   ~4-5GB
```

### Runtime Memory
- Minimal: ~2GB RAM
- With translation: ~4GB RAM
- With large corpus: ~6GB RAM
- GPU optional: Speeds up embeddings

## ‚ùì Decision Guide

### Do I need OCR support?
**YES if:**
- You have scanned books/papers
- PDFs are image-based
- OCR quality is poor

**NO if:**
- All PDFs are clean/modern
- Text is selectable in PDFs

### Do I need translation?
**YES if:**
- You have German academic texts
- Your corpus is multilingual

**NO if:**
- All documents are in English
- You can translate separately

**‚ö†Ô∏è Translation = 2.5GB! Skip this to save space**

### Do I need Zotero integration?
**YES if:**
- You use Zotero for references
- You want citation management

**NO if:**
- You don't use Zotero
- You manage references elsewhere

### Do I need paper auto-download?
**YES if:**
- You frequently need papers by DOI
- You want auto-ingestion

**NO if:**
- You manually download papers
- You don't use DOIs

---

## üöÄ Quick Start Recommendations

### For Your Original Use Case
**Gestalt psychology + Dewey + German texts + scanned books**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**You need everything!** Your requirements justify the full install.

### If You Want to Start Light
```bash
# Start minimal
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt

# Add OCR later if needed
pip install opencv-python pytesseract pypdfium2 Pillow

# Add translation later if needed
pip install torch transformers sentencepiece
```

---

## üîç Verifying Your Install

### Check what you have:
```bash
pip list | grep -E "(llama-index|langchain|chromadb|torch)"
```

### Test specific features:
```bash
# Test basic system
python scripts/test_system.py

# Test OCR (if installed)
python -c "import cv2; print('OCR: OK')"

# Test translation (if installed)
python -c "import torch; print('Translation: OK')"
```

## üì¶ Package Purpose Reference

**llama-index-*** - Document processing pipeline
- Core framework for RAG
- Handles chunking, indexing, retrieval

**langchain/langgraph** - Agent framework
- ReAct reasoning
- Tool orchestration
- Memory management

**chromadb** - Vector database
- Stores embeddings
- Fast similarity search
- Local-first

**torch** - Neural networks
- Required for translation models
- Required for custom embedding models
- **HUGE** (~2GB) but needed for ML

**opencv-python** - Image processing
- Preprocessing for OCR
- Deskewing, denoising, binarization

**transformers** - ML models

- Can load embedding models
- Hugging Face ecosystem

**chainlit** - User interface
- Chat application
- File uploads
- Visual feedback

---

## ‚úÖ My Recommendation

For your **ADHD academic use case with Dewey/Gestalt/German texts**:

### Use full requirements.txt
**Why:**
1. You mentioned German texts ‚Üí need translation
2. You mentioned "poor OCR readings" ‚Üí need OCR pipeline
3. Academic research ‚Üí want all integrations
4. 5GB disk space is reasonable for a research tool

### But you could skip:
- `paperscraper` if you don't auto-download papers
- `tavily-python` if you don't need web search
- `pyzotero` if you don't use Zotero

That would save ~50MB (trivial compared to PyTorch)

---

## üéØ Bottom Line

**The dependencies are heavy BUT justified:**
- PyTorch (2GB) - Needed for German translation
- OpenCV (100MB) - Needed for scanned PDFs
- LlamaIndex/LangChain (300MB) - Core RAG functionality
- Everything else (2GB) - Supporting libraries

**Your use case needs most of this!** The full install is appropriate.

**Want to save space?** Skip translation (saves 2.5GB) if all docs are English.

---

## üìù Installation Commands

### Full Install (Recommended for you)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Minimal Install
```bash
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
```

### Custom Install
```bash
# Core
pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt

# Add what you need
pip install opencv-python pytesseract pypdfium2  # OCR
pip install torch transformers  # Translation
pip install pyzotero  # Zotero
```

---

**Summary:** Yes, you need most of these dependencies for your use case. The full install is ~5GB but includes everything you asked for (OCR, translation, integrations). If you want to start lighter, use requirements-minimal.txt and add features as needed.
